	abstract = {We study the Internal Linear Combination ({ILC}) method presented by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ({WMAP}) science team, with the goal of determining whether it may be used for cosmological purposes, as a template-free alternative to existing foreground correction methods. We conclude that the method does have the potential to do just that, but great care must be taken both in implementation, and in a detailed understanding of limitations caused by residual foregrounds which can still affect cosmological results. As a first step we demonstrate how to compute the {ILC} weights both accurately and efficiently by means of Lagrange multipliers, and apply this method to the observed data to produce a new version of the {ILC} map. Next we describe how to generate Monte Carlo simulations of the {ILC} map, and find that these agree well with the observed map on angular scales up to l{\textasciitilde}200. Finally we make two comments to the on-going debates concerning the large-scale properties of the {WMAP} data. First, we note that the Galactic south-eastern quadrant is associated with notably different {ILC} weights than the other three quadrants, possibly indicating a foreground related anisotropy. Second, we study the properties of the quadrupole and octopole (amplitude, alignment and planarity), and confirm the previously reported anomalies. Even more interestingly, we find that the l=5 mode is spherically symmetric at about 3 sigma, and that the l=6 mode is planar at the 2 sigma level. However, we also assess the impact of residual foregrounds on these statistics, and find that the {ILC} map is not clean enough to allow for cosmological conclusions. Alternative methods must be developed to study these issues further.},

	abstract = {The {WMAP} mission has mapped the full sky to determine the geometry, 
content, and evolution of the universe. Full-sky maps are made in five
microwave frequency bands to separate the temperature anisotropy of the
cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) from foreground emission, including
diffuse Galactic emission and Galactic and extragalactic point sources.
We define masks that excise regions of high foreground emission, so {CMB}
analyses can be carried out with minimal foreground contamination. We
also present maps and spectra of the individual emission components,
leading to an improved understanding of Galactic astrophysical
processes. The effectiveness of template fits to remove foreground
emission from the {WMAP} data is also examined. These efforts result in a
{CMB} map with minimal contamination and a demonstration that the {WMAP} {CMB}
power spectrum is insensitive to residual foreground emission. We use a
maximum entropy method to construct a model of the Galactic emission
components. The observed total Galactic emission matches the model to
less than 1\%, and the individual model components are accurate to a few
percent. We find that the Milky Way resembles other normal spiral
galaxies between 408 {MHz} and 23 {GHz}, with a synchrotron spectral index
that is flattest (βs{\textasciitilde}-2.5) near star-forming regions,
especially in the plane, and steepest (βs{\textasciitilde}-3) in the
halo. This is consistent with a picture of relativistic cosmic-ray
electron generation in star-forming regions and diffusion and convection
within the plane. The significant synchrotron index steepening out of
the plane suggests a diffusion process in which the halo electrons are
trapped in the Galactic potential long enough to suffer synchrotron and
inverse Compton energy losses and hence a spectral steepening. The
synchrotron index is steeper in the {WMAP} bands than in lower frequency
radio surveys, with a spectral break near 20 {GHz} to
βs{\textless}-3. The modeled thermal dust spectral index is
also steep in the {WMAP} bands, with βd{\textasciitilde}2.2. Our model is
driven to these conclusions by the low level of total foreground
contamination at {\textasciitilde}60 {GHz}. Microwave and Hα measurements of the
ionized gas agree well with one another at about the expected levels.
Spinning dust emission is limited to {\textless}{\textasciitilde}5\% of the Ka-band foreground
emission, assuming a thermal dust distribution with a cold neutral
medium spectrum and a monotonically decreasing synchrotron spectrum. A
catalog of 208 point sources is presented. The reliability of the
catalog is 98\%; i.e., we expect five of the 208 sources to be
statistically spurious. The mean spectral index of the point sources is
α{\textasciitilde}0 (β{\textasciitilde}-2). Derived source counts suggest a contribution to
the anisotropy power from unresolved sources of
(15.0+/-1.4)×10-3 μK2 sr at Q band and
negligible levels at V band and W band. The Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect is
shown to be a negligible ``contamination'' to the maps.

Originally developed to address the data processing and analysis needs of the present generation of cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) experiments (e.g. {BOOMERanG}, {WMAP}), {HEALPix} can be expanded to meet many of the profound challenges that will arise in confrontation with the observational output of future missions and experiments, including e.g. Planck, Herschel, {SAFIR}, and the Beyond Einstein {CMB} polarization probe. In this paper we consider the requirements and constraints to be met in order to implement a sufficient framework for the efficient discretization and fast analysis/synthesis of functions defined on the sphere, and summarise how they are satisfied by {HEALPix}.},

	abstract = {We present new full-sky temperature maps in five frequency bands from 23 to 94 {GHz}, based on data from the first 3 years of the {WMAP} sky survey. The new maps are consistent with the first-year maps and are more sensitive. The 3 year maps incorporate several improvements in data processing made possible by the additional years of data and by a more complete analysis of the polarization signal. These include several new consistency tests as well as refinements in the gain calibration and beam response models. We employ two forms of multifrequency analysis to separate astrophysical foreground signals from the {CMB}, each of which improves on our first-year analyses. First, we form an improved Internal Linear Combination ({ILC}) map, based solely on {WMAP} data, by adding a bias-correction step and by quantifying residual uncertainties in the resulting map. Second, we fit and subtract new spatial templates that trace Galactic emission; in particular, we now use low-frequency {WMAP} data to trace synchrotron emission instead of the 408 {MHz} sky survey. The {WMAP} point source catalog is updated to include 115 new sources whose detection is made possible by the improved sky map sensitivity. We derive the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropy using a hybrid approach that combines a maximum likelihood estimate at low l (large angular scales) with a quadratic cross-power estimate for l {\textgreater} 30. The resulting multifrequency spectra are analyzed for residual point source contamination. At 94 {GHz} the unmasked sources contribute 128 ± 27 μK2 to l(l + 1)Cl/2π at l = 1000. After subtracting this contribution, our best estimate of the {CMB} power spectrum is derived by averaging cross-power spectra from 153 statistically independent channel pairs. The combined spectrum is cosmic variance limited to l = 400, and the signal-to-noise ratio per l-mode exceeds unity up to l = 850. For bins of width Δl/l = 3\%, the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds unity up to l = 1000. The first two acoustic peaks are seen at l = 220.8 ± 0.7 and l = 530.9 ± 3.8, respectively, while the first two troughs are seen at l = 412.4 ± 1.9 and l = 675.2 ± 11.1. The rise to the third peak is unambiguous; when the {WMAP} data are combined with higher resolution {CMB} measurements, the existence of a third acoustic peak is well established. Spergel et al. use the 3 year temperature and polarization data to constrain cosmological model parameters. A simple six-parameter Λ{CDM} model continues to fit {CMB} data and other measures of large-scale structure remarkably well. The new polarization data produce a better measurement of the optical depth to reionization, τ = 0.089 ± 0.03. This new and tighter constraint on τ helps break a degeneracy with the scalar spectral index, which is now found to be ns = 0.960 ± 0.016. If additional cosmological data sets are included in the analysis, the spectral index is found to be ns = 0.947 ± 0.015.},

Our main interest is in applications of noisy polarization data and in particular in assessing the feasibility of B-mode detection by Planck. This limits the complexity of foreground subtraction techniques that can be applied to the data. We analyse internal linear combination techniques and show that the offset caused by the dominant E-mode polarization pattern leads to a fundamental limit of r∼ 0.1 for the tensor–scalar ratio even in the absence of instrumental noise. We devise a simple, robust, template fitting technique using multifrequency polarization maps. We show that template fitting using Planck data alone offers a feasible way of recovering primordial B-modes from dominant foreground contamination, even in the presence of noise on the data and templates. We implement and test a pixel-based scheme for computing the likelihood function of cosmological parameters at low multipoles that incorporates foreground subtraction of noisy data.},
