	abstract = {We present a formalism for analyzing a full-sky temperature and polarization map of the cosmic microwave background. Temperature maps are analyzed by expanding over the set of spherical harmonics to give multipole moments of the two-point correlation function. Polarization, which is described by a second-rank tensor, can be treated analogously by expanding in the appropriate tensor spherical harmonics. We provide expressions for the complete set of temperature and polarization multipole moments for scalar and tensor metric perturbations. Four sets of multipole moments completely describe isotropic temperature and polarization correlations; for scalar metric perturbations one set is identically zero, giving the possibility of a clean determination of the vector and tensor contributions. The variance with which the multipole moments can be measured in idealized experiments is evaluated, including the effects of detector noise, sky coverage, and beam width. Finally, we construct coordinate-independent polarization two-point correlation functions, express them in terms of the multipole moments, and derive small-angle limits.},

	abstract = {We present the final nine-year maps and basic results from the Wilkinson 
Microwave Anisotropy Probe ({WMAP}) mission. The full nine-year analysis
of the time-ordered data provides updated characterizations and
calibrations of the experiment. We also provide new nine-year full sky
temperature maps that were processed to reduce the asymmetry of the
effective beams. Temperature and polarization sky maps are examined to
separate cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) anisotropy from foreground
emission, and both types of signals are analyzed in detail. We provide
new point source catalogs as well as new diffuse and point source
foreground masks. An updated template-removal process is used for
cosmological analysis; new foreground fits are performed, and new
foreground-reduced {CMB} maps are presented. We now implement an optimal C
-1 weighting to compute the temperature angular power
spectrum. The {WMAP} mission has resulted in a highly constrained
Λ{CDM} cosmological model with precise and accurate parameters in
agreement with a host of other cosmological measurements. When {WMAP} data
are combined with finer scale {CMB}, baryon acoustic oscillation, and
Hubble constant measurements, we find that big bang nucleosynthesis is
well supported and there is no compelling evidence for a non-standard
number of neutrino species (N eff = 3.84 ± 0.40). The
model fit also implies that the age of the universe is t 0 =
13.772 ± 0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H 0
= 69.32 ± 0.80 km s-1 Mpc-1.
Inflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with
Gaussian random phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar
spectral index from unity, reported earlier by the {WMAP} team, now has
high statistical significance (ns = 0.9608 ± 0.0080);
and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean ({\textbackslash}Omega \_k = -0.0027{\textasciicircum}\{+
0.0039\}\_\{-0.0038\}). Overall, the {WMAP} mission has resulted in a
reduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for
the standard six-parameter Λ{CDM} model, based on {CMB} data alone.
For a model including tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has
been reduced by a factor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in
accord with the {CMB} predictions, and the combined data reduces the
cosmological parameter volume even further. With no significant
anomalies and an adequate goodness of fit, the inflationary flat
Λ{CDM} model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted in {WMAP}
data stands as the standard model of cosmology.},

	abstract = {Planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bands between 30 and 857 {GHz}. These observations allow robust
reconstruction of the primordial cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) temperature fluctuations over nearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on Galactic foregrounds, including thermal dust and line emission from molecular carbon monoxide ({CO}). This paper describes the component separation framework adopted by Planck for many cosmological analyses, including {CMB} power spectrum determination and likelihood construction on large angular scales, studies of primordial
non-Gaussianity and statistical isotropy, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, gravitational lensing, and searches for topological defects. We test four foreground-cleaned {CMB} maps derived using qualitatively different component separation algorithms. The quality of our
reconstructions is evaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shown through various tests to be internally consistent and robust for {CMB} power spectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to ℓ = 2000. The parameter constraints on Λ{CDM} cosmologies
derived from these maps are consistent with those presented in the cross-spectrum based Planck likelihood analysis. We choose two of the {CMB} maps for specific scientific goals. We also present maps and frequency spectra of the Galactic low-frequency, {CO}, and thermal dust emission. The component maps are found to provide a faithful
representation of the sky, as evaluated by simulations, with the largest bias seen in the {CO} component at 3\%. For the low-frequency component, the spectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about β = -4 to - 2. Considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (β{\textless} -3.2) with strong anomalous microwave
emission, corresponding to a spinning dust spectrum peaking below 20 {GHz}, a flat index of β{\textgreater} -2.3 with strong free-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0871},
	abstract = {This paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by Planck {HFI} at 353 {GHz}, which is the most sensitive Planck channel for dust polarization. We construct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction and polarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possible systematic effects. We find that the maximum observed dust polarization fraction is high (pmax {\textgreater} 18\%), in particular in some of the intermediate dust column density ({AV} {\textless} 1mag) regions. There is a systematic decrease in the dust polarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret the features of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignment predictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. We also characterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angle dispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes, the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated by filamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field sky projection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust column density. The polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with the dispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likely due to fluctuations in the 3D magnetic field orientation along the line of sight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.We also compare the dust emission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the Planck {LFI}, with low-frequency radio data, and with Faraday rotation measurements of extragalactic sources. The two polarized components are globally similar in structure along the plane and notably in the Fan and North Polar Spur regions. A detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust and cosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirms that much of the variation observed in the Planck data is due to the 3D structure of the magnetic field.},

One of the easiest ways to determine the magnetic field direction is via polarization of radiation resulting from extinction or/and emission by aligned dust grains. Reliability of interpretation of the polarization maps in terms of magnetic fields depends on how well we understand the grain-alignment theory. Explaining what makes grains aligned has been one of the big issues of the modern astronomy. Numerous exciting physical effects have been discovered in the course of research undertaken in this field. As both the theory and observations matured, it became clear that the grain-alignment phenomenon is inherent not only in diffuse interstellar medium or molecular clouds but also is a generic property of the dust in circumstellar regions, interplanetary space and cometary comae.
Currently the grain-alignment theory is a predictive one, and its results nicely match observations. Among its predictions is a subtle phenomenon of radiative torques. This phenomenon, after having stayed in oblivion for many years after its discovery, is currently viewed as the most powerful means of alignment. In this article, I shall review the basic physical processes involved in grain alignment, and the currently known mechanisms of alignment. I shall also discuss possible niches for different alignment mechanisms. I shall dwell on the importance of the concept of grain helicity for understanding of many properties of grain alignment, and shall demonstrate that rather arbitrarily shaped grains exhibit helicity when they interact with gaseous and radiative flows.},

	abstract = {Radiative Processes in Astrophysics This clear, straightforward, and fundamental introduction is designed to present-from a physicist's point of view-radiation processes and their applications to astrophysical phenomena and space science. It covers such topics as radiative transfer theory, relativistic covariance and kinematics, bremsstrahlung radiation, synchrotron radiation, Compton scattering, some plasma effects, and radiative transitions in atoms. Discussion begins with first principles, physically motivating and deriving all results rather than merely presenting finished formulae. However, a reasonably good physics background (introductory quantum mechanics, intermediate electromagnetic theory, special relativity, and some statistical mechanics) is required. Much of this prerequisite material is provided by brief reviews, making the book a self-contained reference for workers in the field as well as the ideal text for senior or first-year graduate students of astronomy, astrophysics, and related physics courses. Radiative Processes in Astrophysics also contains about 75 problems, with solutions, illustrating applications of the material and methods for calculating results. This important and integral section emphasizes physical intuition by presenting important results that are used throughout the main text; it is here that most of the practical astrophysical applications become apparent.},

	abstract = {We present the Planck Sky Model ({PSM}), a parametric model for generating 
all-sky, few arcminute resolution maps of sky emission at submillimetre
to centimetre wavelengths, in both intensity and polarisation. Several
options are implemented to model the cosmic microwave background,
Galactic diffuse emission (synchrotron, free-free, thermal and spinning
dust, {CO} lines), Galactic H ii regions, extragalactic radio sources,
dusty galaxies, and thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich signals from
clusters of galaxies. Each component is simulated by means of educated
interpolations/extrapolations of data sets available at the time of the
launch of the Planck mission, complemented by state-of-the-art models of
the emission. Distinctive features of the simulations are spatially
varying spectral properties of synchrotron and dust; different spectral
parameters for each point source; modelling of the clustering properties
of extragalactic sources and of the power spectrum of fluctuations in
the cosmic infrared background. The {PSM} enables the production of random
realisations of the sky emission, constrained to match observational
data within their uncertainties. It is implemented in a software package
that is regularly updated with incoming information from observations.
The model is expected to serve as a useful tool for optimising planned
microwave and sub-millimetre surveys and testing data processing and
analysis pipelines. It is, in particular, used to develop and validate
data analysis pipelines within the Planck collaboration. A version of
the software that can be used for simulating the observations for a
variety of experiments is made available on a dedicated website.},

	title = {Planck intermediate results. {XXX}. The angular power spectrum of polarized dust emission at intermediate and high Galactic latitudes},
	volume = {1409},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1409.5738P},
	abstract = {The polarized thermal emission from Galactic dust is the main foreground 
present in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave
background ({CMB}) at frequencies above 100GHz. We exploit the Planck {HFI}
polarization data from 100 to 353GHz to measure the dust angular power
spectra \$C\_{\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}\{{EE},{BB}\}\$ over the range \$40{\textless}{\textbackslash}ell{\textless}600\$ well away
from the Galactic plane. These will bring new insights into interstellar
dust physics and a precise determination of the level of contamination
for {CMB} polarization experiments. We show that statistical properties of
the emission can be characterized over large fractions of the sky using
\$C\_{\textbackslash}ell\$. For the dust, they are well described by power laws in \${\textbackslash}ell\$
with exponents \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textasciicircum}\{{EE},{BB}\}=-2.42{\textbackslash}pm0.02\$. The amplitudes of the
polarization \$C\_{\textbackslash}ell\$ vary with the average brightness in a way similar
to the intensity ones. The dust polarization frequency dependence is
consistent with modified blackbody emission with \${\textbackslash}beta\_d=1.59\$ and
\$T\_d=19.6\$K. We find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the
Galactic \$B\$- and \$E\$-modes of 0.5. We show that even in the faintest
dust-emitting regions there are no "clean" windows where primordial {CMB}
\$B\$-mode polarization could be measured without subtraction of dust
emission. Finally, we investigate the level of dust polarization in the
{BICEP}2 experiment field. Extrapolation of the Planck 353GHz data to
150GHz gives a dust power \${\textbackslash}ell({\textbackslash}ell+1)C\_{\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}\{{BB}\}/(2{\textbackslash}pi)\$ of
\$1.32{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textbackslash}mu\$K\$\_\{{CMB}\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ over the \$40{\textless}{\textbackslash}ell{\textless}120\$ range;
the statistical uncertainty is \${\textbackslash}pm0.29\$ and there is an additional
uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the same
units. This is the same magnitude as reported by {BICEP}2 over this \${\textbackslash}ell\$
range, which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust
signal even in the cleanest windows of the sky.},
