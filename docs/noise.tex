\section{Sky map instrument noise}
\label{sec:noise}

Let us estimate here the noise in each sky (healpix) pixel coming from the
intrinsic noise in each detector pixel.

\subsection{NEP}
\label{sub:nep}

Detector noise is most conveniently quoted in noise-equivalent power (NEP),
which is defined as the amount of optical power that must be incident such
that the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is 1. It is a measure of noise in optical
power units. Note that NEP may be referenced at various different points in
the instrument, e.g. inside the detector, incident on the detector, incident
at the aperture of the telescope. The noise (N) component is intrinsic to the
detector, and so is always referenced to inside the detector. Thus, the S/N =
1 condition must always be enforced inside the detector. For NEPs referenced
at some other point, the signal (S) component must first be transferred to
inside the detector, and then compared. Explicitly,

\begin{description}
    \item[NEP (strict definition)] \hfill \\
    The amount of optical signal power incident at the reference
    point that creates a signal-to-noise ratio of 1 (S/N = 1) as measured
    inside of the detector.
\end{description}

From Richards\cite{richards_bolometers_1994}, we note that the noise in a
bolometer is

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:noisepower}
    \frac{P_N^2}{B} = 2 \int\dd\nu h^2\nu^2 2N(n + n^2) = 2 \int\dd\nu P_\nu h\nu + \int\dd\nu P_\nu^2 \frac{c^2}{A\Omega \nu^2}
\end{equation}

where the first term on the right hand side corresponds to $n$ and the second
term corresponds to $n^2$. $B$ is the detector bandwidth, $N$ is the number of
modes ($N = A\Omega/\lambda^2$, from the Antenna Equation), $n$ is the number
of photons per mode, the 2 in front of the first integral comes from the
conversion between integration time and bandwidth (see below and
Appendix~\ref{sec:bw}), and the 2 inside the integral comes from the 2
polarization states per photon. The energy per photon is $h\nu$. The term
$n + n^2$ is the thermal expectation value for the variation in the number of
photons per mode, $\Avg{(\Delta n)^2} = n + n^2$.

We note that the number of photons per mode is\cite{kittel_thermal_1980}

\begin{equation*}
    n = \frac{1}{\exp{\left( \frac{h\nu}{\kB T} \right)} - 1}
\end{equation*}

where $T$ references the signal (sky) temperature, which is the temperature of
the CMB\cite{fixsen_temperature_2009} in this case, $T = \unit[2.726]{K}$. For
the 4 \piper\ frequency bands (200, 270, 350, 600 GHz), this gives photon
numbers $n$

\begin{align*}
    n = 3\times 10^{-2} & \text{ for } \nu = \unit[200]{GHz} \\
    9\times 10^{-3} & \text{ for } \nu = \unit[270]{GHz} \\
    2\times 10^{-3} & \text{ for } \nu = \unit[350]{GHz} \\
    3\times 10^{-5} & \text{ for } \nu = \unit[600]{GHz}
\end{align*}

We note that $n \ll 1$ for all frequency bands, so $n^2 \ll n$, and we may
ignore the second term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:noisepower}. So we use for the noise
power,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:noisepower2}
    \frac{P_N^2}{B} = 2 \int\dd\nu P_\nu h\nu
\end{equation}

where $P_\nu$ is the power spectral density.

Let us compute the NEP inside the detector using this expression. The NEP is
defined as the amount of power required to give a signal to noise ratio of 1
when there is 1 Hz of noise bandwidth. Note that the signal bandwidth is
already implicitly integrated out of this expression. So we have,

\begin{align*}
    \frac{S}{N} = \frac{\NEP}{P_N(\unit[1]{Hz})} & = 1 \\
    \NEP & = P_N(\unit[1]{Hz}) \\
    \NEP^2 & = \left( \unit[1]{Hz} \right) \cdot \frac{P_N^2}{B}
\end{align*}

Note that in this scenario, NEP has units of W, which strictly matches the
definition given above. However, it is conventional to fold the 1 Hz of
noise bandwidth back into the definition of NEP to remind what the scaling
with bandwidth is and so that a factor of 1 Hz does not need to be carried
around,

\begin{equation*}
    \NEP^2_\mathrm{conventional} = \frac{\NEP^2}{\unit[1]{Hz}} = \frac{P_N^2}{B}
\end{equation*}

where the explicit definition of conventional NEP is

\begin{description}
    \item[NEP (conventional)] \hfill \\
    The amount of optical signal power incident at the reference
    point that creates a signal-to-noise ratio of 1 (S/N = 1) as measured
    inside of the detector, all divided by $\unit[1]{Hz^{1/2}}$.
\end{description}

Henceforth, we will use only the conventional NEP and drop the subscript.

Let us now consider a system with detector absorption
efficiency\footnote{Alternatively called detector absorptivity.} $\eta$ and
optical efficiency $\tau$, where $0 < \eta, \varepsilon, \tau \leq 1$. These
parameters make no difference to the NEP referenced inside the detector.

We will compute the NEP referenced to power incident on the detector. The
signal power incident to the detector will produce an amount of power inside
the detector that is reduced by the factor $\eta$. So the NEP condition is
then

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\eta \cdot \NEP_D}{P_N} = 1
\end{equation*}

and we see that the NEP at the detector input is

\begin{equation}
    \NEP_D^2 = \frac{1}{\eta^2} \frac{P_N^2}{B} = \frac{2}{\eta^2} \int\dd\nu P_\nu h\nu
\end{equation}

Similarly, the NEP referenced to power incident on the primary of the
telescope is determined by noting that the power at the primary must pass
through the optical system, with losses according to the optical efficiency
$\tau$, and then be absorbed by the detector. So our NEP condition is

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\eta \tau \cdot \NEP_P}{P_N} = 1
\end{equation*}

and the NEP at the telescope input is

\begin{equation}
    \NEP_P^2 = \frac{1}{\eta^2\tau^2} \frac{P_N^2}{B} = \frac{2}{\eta^2\tau^2} \int\dd\nu P_\nu h\nu
\end{equation}

We will assume that the NEP inside the detector is known, as it is typically
measured independently.

As a final note, most of the transformations in this section do not tell us
how to calculate the noise power of the bolometer, which is an intrinsic
aspect of the bolometer itself and should be computed from the perspective of
heat inside the detector. It is a property of the detector that is independent
of the optical loading, since optical power is converted to heat, and is
interchangeable with all other sources of heat in the detector (such as
electrical). Rather, what these transformations tell us is how to translate
the intrinsic noise in the detector (encoded as NEP inside the detector) to
reference points outside of the detector. Since the power is transported as
photons coming out of the detector (in the time-reversed sense), we must
understand the properties of the photons and how they transport power in order
to understand how the detector NEP translates to noise at other points. That
is the purpose of this section.

\subsection{NET, NEQ, NEU, NEV}
\label{sub:net_neq_neu_nev}

The first quantity we will examine is the noise-equivalent temperature (NET).
This is the same as the NEP, except in temperature difference units
($\unit{\KCMB}$)\footnote{Also known as CMB temperature units. See
\texttt{docs/foregrounds} for a discussion of these units versus regular
thermodynamic temperature units.}. It is defined as the change in
thermodynamic temperature of a blackbody at the reference point that would
generate an amount of optical power in the detector such that the S/N is 1.
Note that this definition implicitly includes a fair amount of information
about the instrument, such as the etendue, the optical efficiency, and the
frequency band. This information is required since we must know how a change
in the temperature of the sky's photons propagate to the detector, and the
path of propagation is through the instrument. Also note that we must assume a
base sky temperature since the spectral distribution of the sky is
temperature-dependent.

The NET is defined relative to the NEP by

\begin{equation}
    \NET = \frac{\NEP}{\left( \D{P}{T} \right)} \qquad \qquad \text{ in } \unit{\KCMB/\sqrt{Hz}}
\end{equation}

where $\D{P}{T}$ is the change in optical power incident on the detector due
to a change in sky temperature. This is straight-forward to compute if we
first find the power incident on the detector, which is

\begin{equation}
    P(T) = \int_{\Delta\nu} \dd\nu\ \eta(\nu) \tau(\nu) P_\nu(T) = A\Omega \int_{\Delta\nu} \dd\nu\ \eta(\nu) \tau(\nu) B_\nu(T)
\end{equation}

where $\Delta\nu$ is the passband and $B_\nu(T)$ is the Planck distribution,
which we note already includes both polarization modes,

\begin{equation*}
    B_\nu(T) = \frac{2h}{c^2} \frac{\nu^3}{\exp{\left( \frac{h\nu}{\kB T} \right)}}.
\end{equation*}

Then $\D{P}{T}$ is given by

\begin{equation*}
    \D{P}{T} = A\Omega \int_{\Delta\nu} \dd\nu\ \eta(\nu) \tau(\nu) \D{B_\nu(T)}{T}
\end{equation*}

The derivative of the Planck distribution can be shown to be

\begin{equation*}
    \D{B_\nu(T)}{T} = \frac{2h^2}{c^2\kB T^2} \frac{\nu^4 \exp\left( \frac{h\nu}{\kB T} \right)}{\left[ \exp\left( \frac{h\nu}{\kB T} \right) - 1 \right]^2}
\end{equation*}

so

\begin{equation}
    \D{P}{T} = A\Omega \int_{\Delta\nu} \dd\nu\ \eta(\nu) \frac{2h^2}{c^2\kB T^2} \frac{\nu^4 \exp\left( \frac{h\nu}{\kB T} \right)}{\left[ \exp\left( \frac{h\nu}{\kB T} \right) - 1 \right]^2}
\end{equation}

which may be put in the more numerically convenient form by using the
substitution $x = \frac{h}{\kB T} \nu$,

\begin{equation}
    \D{P}{T} = A\Omega \frac{2\kB}{c^2} \left( \frac{\kB T}{h} \right)^3 \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \dd x\ \eta(x)\tau(x) \frac{x^4 e^x}{\left( e^x - 1 \right)^2}
\end{equation}

The integral does not have a nice algebraic solution even if $\eta(x)\tau(x)$ is
constant, but is amenable to quadrature for realistic bandpass functions
$\eta(x)$. We note, as discussed above, that the etendue ($A\Omega$), the
band-pass, the efficiency, and the sky temperature are involved in this
conversion factor.

The units of $P$ is \unit{W}, so $\left[\D{P}{T}\right] = \unit{\frac{W}{\KCMB}}$,
and

\begin{equation*}
    \left[ \NET \right] = \left[ \frac{\NEP}{\left( \D{P}{T} \right)} \right] = \unit{\frac{W}{\sqrt{Hz}}} \unit{\frac{K}{W}} = \unit{\frac{K}{\sqrt{Hz}}}
\end{equation*}

However the conventional unit for NET is $\unit{\KCMB \sqrt{s}}$, for which the
procedure to get the noise figure in K is to divide by the square root of the
integration time, i.e. more integration time results in less noise. This is
conceptually intuitive, since one would expect that the measurement from each
period of time would be independent, so the number of independent samples
would go like $f_\mathrm{sample} \cdot T_\mathrm{integration}$, and the noise
would go down by the square root of the number of independent samples.

We note that formally the units $\unit{\frac{\KCMB}{\sqrt{Hz}}}$ and
$\unit{\KCMB \sqrt{s}}$ are equivalent. However, the conversion between the two is
a bit more subtle. We wish to convert between units of bandwidth to units of
integration time, but due to the Nyquist sampling theorem, we must integrate
for 2 seconds to get 1 Hz of bandwidth (see Appendix~\ref{sec:bw}). So the correct conversion factor is

\begin{equation*}
    1 = \frac{\unit[2]{s}}{\unit[1]{Hz^{-1}}}
\end{equation*}

Then the NET may be written in conventional units as

\begin{equation}
    \NET = \left( \sqrt{2} \frac{\unit{\sqrt{s}}}{\unit{Hz^{-1/2}}} \right) \frac{\NEP}{\left( \D{P}{T} \right)} \qquad \qquad \text{ in } \unit{\KCMB \sqrt{s}}
\end{equation}

Next let us examine the noise-equivalent Q-parameter (NEQ). Again this is
simply a unit transformation, this time from temperature intensity units
($\unit{\KCMB}$) to polarization intensity units (also in $\unit{\KCMB}$). NEQ
is a noise-equivalent measure of the amount of noise in the measurement of the
Stokes Q parameter. There is also a noise-equivalent U-parameter (NEU), but it
is usually identical to NEQ, so typically only NEQ is listed. The conventional
units of NEQ are the same as NET, $\unit{\KCMB \sqrt{s}}$. There is also a
noise-equivalent V-parameter (NEV), which has the same units and a similar
interpretation. It is rarely listed, since the V-parameter is rarely of
interest.

To convert from NET to NEQ, we note that in order to measure the temperature
intensity, we need only to measure 1 number. However, to measure the
polarization, we must measure 3 numbers ($Q$, $U$, and $V$, or equivalently,
$E_x$, $E_y$, and $\phi$). Because of this, we must split our observation time
to measuring 3 different things, so for a single parameter, we get only a
fraction of the observation time. If the observation time is split between
$Q$, $U$, and $V$ according to the ratios $f_Q$, $f_U$, and $f_V$ (where $0
\leq f_X \leq 1$ and $f_Q + f_U + f_V = 1$), then we will reduce the
observation time for $Q$ according to $T_\mathrm{integration} \to f_Q
T_\mathrm{integration}$ (and similarly for U and V). Then since the number of
independent measurements is linear in the integration time, $N_\mathrm{obs} =
f_\mathrm{sample} T_\mathrm{integration}$, we get only a fraction of the
number of independent samples, $N_\mathrm{obs} \to f_Q N_\mathrm{obs}$. This
change results in a $1/\sqrt{f_Q}$ increase in noise, since noise goes like
$1/\sqrt{N_\mathrm{obs}}$. Thus, the generic conversions from NET to NEQ, NEU,
and NEV are

\begin{align*}
    \NEQ & = \left( \sqrt{\frac{2}{f_Q}} \frac{\unit{\sqrt{s}}}{\unit{Hz^{-1/2}}} \right) \frac{\NEP}{\left( \D{P}{T} \right)} \qquad \qquad \text{ in } \unit{\KCMB \sqrt{s}} \\
    \NEU & = \left( \sqrt{\frac{2}{f_U}} \frac{\unit{\sqrt{s}}}{\unit{Hz^{-1/2}}} \right) \frac{\NEP}{\left( \D{P}{T} \right)} \qquad \qquad \text{ in } \unit{\KCMB \sqrt{s}} \\
    \NEV & = \left( \sqrt{\frac{2}{f_V}} \frac{\unit{\sqrt{s}}}{\unit{Hz^{-1/2}}} \right) \frac{\NEP}{\left( \D{P}{T} \right)} \qquad \qquad \text{ in } \unit{\KCMB \sqrt{s}}
\end{align*}

For \piper, the VPM modulation strategy results in a demodulation such that
$\sqrt{f_Q} = \sqrt{f_U} = \frac{4}{3}\sqrt{f_V}$.\footnote{See \piper\
proposal, if available to you...} Combining this with the normalization
condition, $f_Q + f_U + f_V = 1$, we see that

\begin{equation}
    f_Q = f_U = \frac{16}{41} \simeq 0.3902 \qquad\text{and}\qquad f_V = \frac{9}{41} \simeq 0.2195.
\end{equation}

which gives us the \piper-specific conversions,

\begin{align}
    \NEQ = \NEU & = \left( \frac{\sqrt{82}}{4} \frac{\unit{\sqrt{s}}}{\unit{Hz^{-1/2}}} \right) \frac{\NEP}{\left( \D{P}{T} \right)} = \left( \frac{2.264 \unit{\sqrt{s}}}{\unit{Hz^{-1/2}}} \right) \frac{\NEP}{\left( \D{P}{T} \right)} \qquad \qquad \text{ in } \unit{\KCMB \sqrt{s}} \\
    \NEV & = \left( \frac{\sqrt{82}}{3} \frac{\unit{\sqrt{s}}}{\unit{Hz^{-1/2}}} \right) \frac{\NEP}{\left( \D{P}{T} \right)} = \left( \frac{3.018 \unit{\sqrt{s}}}{\unit{Hz^{-1/2}}} \right) \frac{\NEP}{\left( \D{P}{T} \right)} \qquad \qquad \text{ in } \unit{\KCMB \sqrt{s}}
\end{align}

Lastly, note that we have not specified the reference point for the NEP in any
of these calculations. All of these conversions are independent of the
efficiencies of the telescope and detector, so moving the reference point of
the NEP will change the reference point of the derived quantity (e.g. NEQ or
NEU) in the same way. Thus, the derived quantities (NEQ, NEU, NEV) have
reference points, and the reference point of the derived quantity is the same
as the NEP that was used to construct it. Transforming a derived quantity to
move the reference point is done in the same way that transforming the NEP is
done.

\subsection{Sensitivity}
\label{sub:sensitivity}

Now that we have in hand the NEQ, which describes the noise in a given
detector pixel and how it depends on integration time, we turn to estimating
the amount of noise in a given sky pixel. We have already accounted for the
noise properties of the detector (encoded in the NEP), so the frame of the
detectors is no longer convenient. We are really interested in the noise in
each sky pixel, not in the noise in each detector pixel, so we must project
the detector noise back onto the sky. Then we can accumulate the integration
time in each pixel and get the noise in each sky pixel.

Let us write the NEQ at the telescope input,

\begin{align}
    \NEQ^2_P & = \left( \frac{2}{f_Q} \frac{\unit{s}}{\unit{Hz^{-1}}} \right) \frac{\NEP^2_P}{\left( \D{P}{T} \right)^2} = \left( \frac{2}{f_Q} \frac{\unit{s}}{\unit{Hz^{-1}}} \right) \frac{1}{\eta^2 \tau^2}\frac{\NEP^2}{\left( \D{P}{T} \right)^2} \notag\\
    & = \left( \frac{2}{f_Q} \frac{\unit{s}}{\unit{Hz^{-1}}} \right) \frac{1}{\eta^2 \tau^2} \frac{2 \int\dd\nu P_\nu h\nu}{\left[ A\Omega \frac{2\kB}{c^2} \left( \frac{\kB T}{h} \right)^3 \eta \tau \int \dd x \frac{x^4 e^x}{e^x - 1}\right]^2} \notag \\
    & = \left( \frac{2}{f_Q} \frac{\unit{s}}{\unit{Hz^{-1}}} \right) \frac{1}{\eta^2 \tau^2} \frac{4 A\Omega \left( \frac{\kB T}{h} \right)^5 \eta \tau \int \frac{x^4}{e^x - 1}\ \dd x}{ (A\Omega)^2 \frac{4\kB^2}{c^4} \left( \frac{\kB T}{h} \right)^6 \eta^2 \tau^2 \left[ \int \dd x \frac{x^4 e^x}{e^x - 1}\right]^2} \notag \\
    \NEQ^2_P & = \left( \frac{2}{f_Q} \frac{\unit{s}}{\unit{Hz^{-1}}} \right) \frac{1}{\eta^3 \tau^3} \frac{I_1}{I_2^2} \frac{h^3 c^2}{\kB^3 T}\frac{1}{A\Omega}
\end{align}

where $I_1 = \int \dd x \frac{x^4}{e^x - 1}$ and $I_2 = \int \dd x \frac{x^4 e^x}{e^x - 1}$.

% \section{OLD JUNK}

% First we project the noise in a single detector out to the sky. Each pixel
% looks at a solid angle the size of the beamspot, $\Omega_b$. We must be
% careful to keep in mind that we are dealing with noise, which adds in
% quadrature with independent regions, and not pure signal, which adds linearly.
% If the entire beamspot had a temperature noise of $\unit[1]{\mu K}$, then we
% would measure a noise on the detector of $\unit[1]{\mu K}$. If we arbitrarily subdivided
% the beamspot into $M$ different equal-area subregions indexed by $i$, each with
% independent noise $N_i$ (units of K), then if each subregion has the same noise,
% then we should end up with the same detector noise (since we're merely counting
% in a different way). We note that each

% \begin{equation}
%     \sqrt{\sum_i \frac{1}{M}\left( \unit[1]{\mu K} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{M}{M} \left(\unit[1]{\mu K} \right)^2} = \unit[1]{\mu K}
% \end{equation}


% If the entire
% beamspot had a changed temperature by $\unit[1]{\mu K}$, then the power incident on
% the detector would change temperature by $\unit[1]{\mu K}$.

% First we project the noise in a single detector out to the sky. Each pixel
% looks at a solid angle the size of the beamspot, $\Omega_b$. If the entire
% beamspot changed temperature by $\unit[1]{\mu K}$, then the power incident on
% the detector would change temperature by $\unit[1]{\mu K}$. If a subregion
% inside the beamspot with 1/10th the solid angle changed temperature (with the
% rest of the beamspot held at fixed temperature), then the subregion would have
% to change in temperature by $\unit[10]{\mu K}$ to induce a $\unit[1]{\mu K}$
% change in the power on the detector. Thus, the projection operation changes
% our units from K to K/sr, and the appropriate scaling factor is $\Omega_b$. We
% note that this projection is independent of the pixelization scheme, and so
% the quantity constructed is valid for any pixelation scheme (e.g. HealPIX),
% and any number of pixels within a scheme (i.e. arbitrary $N_\mathrm{side}$).
% This quantity is called the sensitivity, or alternatively the sensitivty per
% beamspot, or other combinations of ``beam'' and ``sensitivity'', and we shall
% denote it here by $F$,

% \begin{equation}
%     F = \frac{\NEQ}{\Omega_b} \qquad \text{with units} \qquad \left[ F \right] = \frac{\unit{K \sqrt{s}}}{\unit{sr}}
% \end{equation}

% Next we accumulate the integration time. Suppose our instrument uniformly
% measures a solid angle $\Omega_T$ in a period of time $T$. The solid angle
% $\Omega_T$ covers $N_b = \Omega_T/\Omega_b$ non-overlapping (i.e. independent)
% beamspots. Thus, we may distribute the integration time period $T$ into $N_b$
% independent regions, for an integration time per beamspot $T_b$ of

% \begin{equation*}
%     T_b = \frac{T}{N_b} = \left( \frac{\Omega_b}{\Omega_T} \right) T
% \end{equation*}

\section{Relationship between Integration Time and Bandwidth}
\label{sec:bw}

Suppose we integrate a signal $x(t)$ for a period of time $T$. This is
equivalent to filtering the signal with a rect filter,

\begin{equation}
    h(t) = \rect(t/T) = u(t - \nicefrac{T}{2}) - u(t + \nicefrac{T}{2}),
\end{equation}

where $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. In harmonic space, this filter is

\begin{equation}
    H(f) = F\{ h(t) \} = T \sinc{( f T )} = T \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T}
\end{equation}

where we define our fourier transform as

\begin{equation*}
    F \{ x(t) \} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \dd f\ x(t) \exp(-2\pi i f t)
\end{equation*}

The bandwidth of a signal is conventionally defined as the distance in
frequency space between the first positive and first negative node. We note
that the sinc function is symmetric and has its first node at $f = 1/T$,
so the bandwidth is $B = 2/T$. Thus the relationship between integration time
and bandwidth is

\begin{align*}
    \unit[T]{seconds\ integration\ time} & \longleftrightarrow \unit[\frac{2}{T}]{Hz\ bandwidth} \\
    \unit[1]{second\ integration\ time} & \longleftrightarrow \unit[2]{Hz\ bandwidth}
\end{align*}

and so the conversion between seconds of integration time and Hz of bandwidth is

\begin{equation}
    1 = \frac{\unit[1]{s}}{\unit[\frac{1}{2}]{Hz^{-1}}} = \frac{\unit[2]{s}}{\unit[1]{Hz^{-1}}}
\end{equation}

Note that for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, whether we do the
integration in the time domain all at once or over a series of bursts, the
result must be the same. We could simply time-shift all of the individual
bursts to be right next to each other, thereby recreating the full-width rect.
